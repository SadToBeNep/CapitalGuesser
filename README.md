# What is this exactly?
Well, this project idea came from a YouTube video, where a junior webdev got a task to complete in 2h, so I attempt to do that

# The task
So, the main concept of this app, is that you have countries and their capitals, you need to make a app that displays X amount of buttons, half of them with countries the other half with the cities
and you need to make it so the user can click on each, and if it matches the buttons disappear, so basically we need to find the correct capital for a country

## Requirements
1. The buttons should be displayed in random order
2. Clicking a button should set it's background color to blue (4009bff)
3. Clicking another button should:
    .Remove both buttons if a correct country and capital pair was selected
    .Set the background color of both buttons to red (rreeee) if a wrong pair was selected(back to default when another is clicked)
4. When there are no buttons left, display "You won" + button to restart
5. Something about exporting component as the default export, now not sure what this means since this task was given on a JS job interview
